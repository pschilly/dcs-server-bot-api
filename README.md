This package acts as an interface service for the DCS Server Bot RestAPI in order to access information from the bot on a remote web server for display purposes.

In order for this to be function, you must already have the [DCS Server Bot](https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot) setup and running, including the following plugin / service:

-   RestAPI [Docs](https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot/blob/master/plugins/restapi/README.md)
-   WebService [Docs](https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot/blob/master/services/webservice/README.md)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pschilly/dcs-server-bot-api
```

## Configuration

In order for the service to know where to make the API calls you must identify where the API server is located. By default, the service will look for `http://localhost:9876` - this is only going to be useful if you are running your website on the same server as the **master node** of the DCS Server bot.

To alter this default URL, run one of the following commands:

```bash
php artisan dci-server-bot-api:install
```

```bash
php artisan dci-server-bot-api:install --url="http://localhost:9867" [--force]
```

you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="dcs-server-bot-api-config"
```

Although possible, it is not necessary as the singular config parameter is pulled from your applications .env. Never the less, this is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | DCS Bot API URL
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This value is the base URL for the DCS Bot API, which will be used when
    | making requests to the API endpoints.
    |
    | See documentation of DCS Server Bot API for more details & configuration on your actual DCS Server Bot.
    |   WebService: https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot/blob/master/services/webservice/README.md
    |   RestAPI: https://github.com/Special-K-s-Flightsim-Bots/DCSServerBot/blob/master/plugins/restapi/README.md
    |
    */

    'base_url' => env('DCS_BOT_API_URL', 'http://localhost:9876'),

];
```
